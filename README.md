# Grab Integrated App – Portfolio v1

A React Native + Expo mobile app inspired by the Grab super app.  
This project focuses on reproducing the core user journey – from splash screen to main service UI – as a production-style portfolio piece, rather than a fully integrated backend service.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I design and build a real-world mobile app flow:

- Splash → Loader → Intro Login → Auth Options → Main Service UI
- Clean navigation structure using React Navigation
- Login options for Facebook, Google, Apple, and mobile number
- **Portfolio v1**: all four login buttons currently use a temporary bypass to enter the main service screen (no real OAuth yet)

This repository is part of my developer portfolio, showcasing:
- Mobile UI/UX implementation with React Native and Expo
- Practical app structure that can be extended with real OAuth and backend integration in future versions
